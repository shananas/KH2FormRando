KH2FormRando

Credits since the mod.yml is rewritten constantly
Thanks to 1234567890num for making the program to randomize, continuing to improve it and add everything the .exe can do. All file edits done outside of code done by me. Thanks to DA for his knowledge by doing an Anti Form over Base Sora mod. Also thanks to Zurph from the OpenKH discord again since anytime I have a question he always has an easy answer and for also fixing blizzard and fire magic visual on PC (The visuals were messed up because of a different crash fix). Thanks to Xaddx for saying how to give Anti Form a keyblade for certain actions (Anti can no longer softlock because of this, the Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe has been removed).

PC/PCSX 99.9% Stable

Read known issues for a few precautions as to not freeze/crash. Its pretty stable but there is one crash on PCSX/PC

There may be some limited T-posing that still exists. This should only happen with Boss/Enemy rando and maybe other memory intensive options.

All Forms including Base Sora are randomized. To re-randomize, run Randomize.exe from the installed mod location.
To easily there, click on KH2FormRando in the mod manager and click mods open mod folder.
When using Randomize.exe
Base Sora can only be regular Sora, Wisdom Form, Limit Form, or Anti Form.

Everything else is fully random. Form exp requirements stay vanilla(So in whatever replaced Limit Form you still need to use limits to level it). EX: if Final Form becomes Base Sora have fun leveling up final as Base Sora.
